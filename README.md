# Soul Linux

A lightweight, fast, Secure and hybrid base Linux distro.

# Our aim
Our aim is to make Linux popular and stable as a Desktop operating system. We deliver enterprise level security to Desktop users. Linux was initially made to be a Desktop OS, but due to it's secure and lightweight nature has become a Server OS. We are hoping to make Linux the best Desktop Operating System. And show the world that Linux can be just as good as a Desktop os. We are not trying to compete with Windows or Mac but we want to get Linux the same popularity as these both operating systems. Our source code is available on Github and Gitlab.

# Important Note
Soul Linux is currently under development by Venkatesh Mishra, please do not use any of the code until the first release of Soul Linux is publicly released. The development stages are aslo open source to make sure we are following the Security measures to patch the vulnerabilities in our code. Please do wait for the development to be finished. Until then you can help by contributing code. Soul Linux is a community made project and not backed by any company so the development time could take a while. We request you to wait patinelty for the first release.
We hope you enjoy using our Operating System once it's made. Please do co-operate with us and help us by contributing code. We are currently in search of anyone who can help use with the GUI applications for Soul Linux, and are hoping we will soon get people wanting to help us.
